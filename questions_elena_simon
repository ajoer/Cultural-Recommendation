questions:

1) for normalizing language-pair links:
	now I've normalized by size of l1 version. But this favors small lvs.
	How to normalize?

2) I don't think we should focus on "missing" language links, because they will be hard to find and we are looking to recommend pages that are not already there. 

3) events can have more than one type, e.g Hong Kong elections are both subtype "voting" and "meeting"

for event in events:

	if check_if_page_exists == True: continue

	page_probability = calculate_page_probability(event_type, event_geo, LVs_with)

	if page_probability > threshold:
		recommend_page == True
